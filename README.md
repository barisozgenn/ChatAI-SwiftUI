# ChatAI-SwiftUI

Shall we carry ChatGPT in our pocket? Would it not be advantageous to have ChatGPT readily accessible through our mobile devices? 
Especially, when accompanied by our bespoke applications, crafted with the cutting-edge technologies of SwiftUI and Flutter. Our applications feature a sophisticated chat interface, utilizing Chat bubble animations, seamlessly integrated with OpenAI APIs such as DALL-E and ChatGPT 3.5 turbo APIs. I am delighted to share with you the source codes of these applications, which are not only available for your personal use, but also serve as valuable resources for your future projects.
